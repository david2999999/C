- Except for 'bool' and the extended character types
    - The integral types may be signed or unsigned
        - A signed type represents negative or positive numbers (including zero)
        - An unsigned type represents only values greater than or equal to zero
- The types 'int, short, long, and long long' are all signed
    - We obtain the corresponding unsigned type by adding 'unsigned' to the type
        - Such as 'unsigned long'
        - The type 'unsigned int' may be abbreviated as 'unsigned'
