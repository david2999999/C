- Except for 'bool' and the extended character types
    - The integral types may be signed or unsigned
        - A signed type represents negative or positive numbers (including zero)
        - An unsigned type represents only values greater than or equal to zero
- The types 'int, short, long, and long long' are all signed
    - We obtain the corresponding unsigned type by adding 'unsigned' to the type
        - Such as 'unsigned long'
        - The type 'unsigned int' may be abbreviated as 'unsigned'

- There are three distinct basic character types:
    - char, signed char and unsigned char
        - 'char' is not the same type as 'signed char'
    - Although there are three types, there are only two representations: signed and unsigned
- In an unsigned type, all the bits represent the value
    - For example, an 8 bit 'unsigned char' can hold the values from 0 -> 255 inclusive
        - An 8 bit 'signed char' is guaranteed to be able to hold values from -127 through 127
            - Most modern computers use representations that allow values from -128 through 127
