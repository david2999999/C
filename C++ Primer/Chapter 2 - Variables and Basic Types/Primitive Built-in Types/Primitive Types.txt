- C++ defines a set of primitive types that include the arithmetic types
  and a special type named void
    - The arithmetic types represent characters, integers, boolean values,
      and floating point numbers
    - The void type has no associated value and can be used in only a few
      circumstances, most commonly as the return type for functions that
      do not return a value

- The arithmetic types are divided into two categories: integral types (which include
  character and boolean types) and floating-point types.
