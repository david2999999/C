- Character enclosed within single quotes is a literal of type 'char'
    - Zero or more characters enclosed in double quotation marks is
      a string literal
        - 'a' // character literal
        - "Hello World!" // string literal
- The type of a string literal is array of constant chars
    - The compiler appends a null character ('\0') to every string literal
        - The literal 'A' represents the single character A
            - whereas the string literal "A" represents an array of two characters,
              the letter A and the null character.
- Two string literals that appear adjacent to one another and that are separated only
  by spaces, tabs, or newlines are concatenated into a single literal.
    - We use this form of literal when we need to write a literal that would otherwise
      be too large to fit comfortably on a single line:
        - // multiline string literal
            - std::cout << "a really, really long string literal "
