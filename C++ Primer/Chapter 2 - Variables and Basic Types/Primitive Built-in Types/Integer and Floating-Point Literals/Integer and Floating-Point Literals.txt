- We can write integer literal using decimal, octal, and hexadecimal
  notation.
    - Integer literals that begins with 0 (zero) are interpreted as octal
    - Those that begin with either 0x or 0X are interpreted as hexadecimal
    - We can write the number 20 in the following way
        - 20  decimal
        - 024 octal
        - 0x14 hexadecimal

- The type of an integer literal depends on its value and notation
    - By default, decimal literals are signed whereas octal and hexadecimal literals
      can be either signed or unsigned types
        - A decimal literal has the smallest type of 'int, long or long long'
        - Octal literals have the smallest type of 'int, unsigned int, long, unsigned
          long, long long, or unsigned long long'
    - It is an error to use a literal that is too larger to fit in the largest
      related type
        - There are no literals of type 'short'
