- Conventions for Variable Names
    - An identifier should give some indication of its meaning
    - Variable names normally are lowercase - index
    - Like Sales_item, classes we define usually being with an uppercase letter
    - Identifiers with multiple words should visually distinguish each word
        - For example, student_loan or studentLoan
