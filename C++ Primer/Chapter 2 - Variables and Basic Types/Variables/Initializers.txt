- An object that is initialized gets the specified value at the moment it is created
    - The values used to initialize a variable can be arbitrarily complicated expressions
- When a definition defines two or more variables
    - The name of each object becomes visible immediately
        - It is possible to initialize a variable to the value of one defined earlier
          in the same definition
               // ok: price is defined and initialized before it is used to initialize discount
              double price = 109.99, discount = price * 0.16;
              // ok: call applyDiscount and use the return value to initialize salePrice
              double salePrice = applyDiscount(price, discount);
- NOTE: initialization and assignment are different operations in C++
    - Initialization happens when a variable is given a value when it is created
    - Assignment obliterates an object's current value and replaces that value with a new one
