- One way in which initialization is a complicated topic is that the
  language defines serveral different forms of initialization
    - There are four different ways to define an 'int' variable and initialize
      it to 0
        - int units_sold = 0;
        - int units_sold = {0};
        - int units_sold{0};
        - int units_sold(0);
    - The generalized use of curly braces for initialization was introduced as
      part of the new standard
        - This initialization is referred to as list initialization
    - This form of initialization has one important property
        - The compiler will not let us list initialize variables of built-in type
          if the initializer might lead to the loss of information
            - long double ld = 3.1415926536;
            - int a{ld}, b = {ld}; // error: narrowing conversion required
            - int c(ld), d = ld; // ok: but value will be truncated
