- A simple variable definition consists of a type specifier, followed by a list of one
  or more variable names separated by commas, and ends with a semicolon
    - int sum = 0, value, // sum, value, and units_sold have type int
      units_sold = 0; // sum and units_sold have initial value 0
    - Sales_item item; // item has type Sales_item
    - std::string book("0-201-78345-X"); // book initialized from string literal
        - The definition of book uses the 'std::string' library type
            - Like iosteam, string is defined in namespace 'std'
        - The 'string' type is a type that represents a variable-length sequence of characters
