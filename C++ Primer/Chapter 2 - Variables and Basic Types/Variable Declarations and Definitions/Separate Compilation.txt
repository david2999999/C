- To allow programs to be written in logical parts
    - C++ supports separate compilation
    - It lets us split our programs into several files, each of which
      can be compiled independently
- When we separate a program into multiple files
    - We need a way to share code across those files
        - A concrete example is 'std::cout' and 'std::cin'
- To support separate compilation
    - C++ distinguishes between declaration and definition
        - Declaration makes a name known to the program
            - A file that wants to use a name elsewhere includes a declaration for that name
        - A definition creates the associated entity
- To obtain a declaration that is not also a definition
    - We add the 'extern' keyword and may not provide an explicit initializer
        - extern int i; // declares but does not define i
        - extern double pi = 3.1416; // definition
