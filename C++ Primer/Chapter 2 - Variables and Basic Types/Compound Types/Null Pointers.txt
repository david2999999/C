- A null pointer does not point to any object
    - Code can check whether a pointer is null before attempting to use it
- There are several ways to obtain a null pointer
    - int *p1 = nullptr; // equivalent to int *p1 = 0;
    - int *p2 = 0; // directly initializes p2 from the literal constant 0
    - int *p3 = NULL; // equivalent to int *p3 = 0;
        - // must #include cstdlib
- The most direct approach is to initialize the pointer using the literal 'nullptr'
    - This has been introduced by the new standard
- A recommendation is to initialize all variables is particularly important
  for pointers
    - If possible, define a pointer only after the object to which it should point
      has been defined
        - If there is no object to bind to a pointer, then initialize
          the pointer to nullptr or zero
            - This allows the program to detect that the pointer
              does not point to an object
