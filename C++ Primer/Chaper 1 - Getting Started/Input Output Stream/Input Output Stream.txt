Input/Output
    - C++ includes an extensive standard library that provides IO.
        - Fundamental to the iostream library has two types
            - istream and ostream
            - Which represents input and output streams
    - A stream is a sequence of characters read from or written to an IO device
        - The term stream is intended to suggest that the characters are generated,
          or consumed, sequentially over time
    - To handle input, we use an object of type istream named 'cin'
        - This object is also referred to as the standard input
    - To handle output, we use an ostream object named 'cout'
        - This object is also referred to as the standard output
        - There are also two other ostream objects
            - cerr and clog
                - 'cerr' is for standard error
                - 'clog' is for general information about the execution of the program

Code
    - The first line of the program '#include <iostream>' tells the compiler that we want to
      use the iostream library
        - The name inside angle brackets refers to a header
        - Every program that uses a library facility must include its associated header
    - The #include directive must be written on a single line
        - The name of the header and the #include must appear on the same line
    - In general, #include directives must appear outside any function
        - Typically, we put the #include directives for a program at the beginning of the
          source file
